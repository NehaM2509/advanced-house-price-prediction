# 🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction System

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts house prices using a Random Forest Regression model.

The application automatically trains on the California Housing dataset and allows users to input property details to receive real-time price predictions through an interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
